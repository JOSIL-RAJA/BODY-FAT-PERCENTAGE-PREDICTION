# BODY FAT % PREDICTION
In this project, we aimed to develop a machine learning model for predicting body fat 
percentage using easily accessible features such as age, weight, and body measurements. By 
exploring various regression models including Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regression, 
Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor, we aimed to find the most effective 
model for this prediction task. After thorough evaluation, we found that the Linear 
Regression model consistently outperformed the other models, achieving the highest Rsquared score on the test dataset. This indicates that the Linear Regression model can 
explain a significant portion of the variability in body fat percentage based on the selected 
features. Our findings suggest that machine learning can offer a non-invasive and accessible 
method for estimating body fat percentage, which could be valuable for health and fitness 
assessments.
